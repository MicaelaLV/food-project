## Approach taken

The first thing we did was writing down all the feautures we wanted to build. Then we went throught the logical model we created, in order to divide the tasks required and the job between us. 

Back end has been our biggest focus since we started studying it two weeks ago and this was our first complete exercise. 

We then moved into the styling and the front end, in the last hours before the release: Friday 21st of July 2017.
